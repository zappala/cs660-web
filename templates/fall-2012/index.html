      <h1 class="top">Syllabus</h1>

      <p>This graduate course explores advanced topics in computer
      networks, focusing on fundamental research being conducted to
      improve the Internet. The course covers a set of classic
      research papers from a broad spectrum of topics, mixed with some
      of the latest research in these areas. Topics include congestion
      control, routing, Internet measurements, social networking, and
      wireless networking.</p>

      <p>The prerequisite for this course
      is <a href="http://cs460.byu.edu">CS 460 Computer Communications
      and Networking</a> or its equivalent.</p>

      <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

      <p>At the end of the course, students should be able to:</p>

      <ul>

	<li>understand a broad set of Internet research
	  topics and the open research issues in the area,</li>

	<li>have some expertise in the methods used to conduct
	  Internet research,</li>

	<li>the ability to conduct independent and original research,
	  including formulating research questions, studying related
	  work, formulating solutions, collecting and analyzing data,
	  and presenting research results.</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Organization</h2>

      <p>We will study one research area every two weeks.  For the
	first week, we will all read and discuss the same papers.  For
	the second week, each student will select and read a different
	paper and then we will discuss these in class.  The papers
	chosen should be the most important in the area. By the end of
	the two weeks, each student should be familiar with the
	area.</p>

      <h2>Materials</h2>

      <p>Links to research papers will be available on the class web
	site.  Additional papers can be found in the IEEE and ACM
	digital libraries, which are available free from on
	campus.</p>

      <p>For the labs you may need reference material on various
	programming languages, depending on your prior background and the type
	of project you do. Regardless of the project, you will be most
	successful if you use a scripting language to process your data and
	generate plots. Here are the Python and C++ books that I
	recommend:</p>

      <ul>

	<li>

	  <a href="http://www.diveintopython.org/toc/index.html">Dive Into Python</a>

	</li>
	<li>

	  <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCSpy/">How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python</a>

	</li>
	<li><i>Practical C++ Programming</i>, 2nd Edition, by Steve Oualline,
	  O'Reilly &amp; Associates, December 2002, ISBN 0-596-00419-2.</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Assignments</h2>

      <p>We will maintain a shared Wiki for the class that will cover
	the general topic of Internet research.  Each student will be
	responsible for writing a one-paragraph summary of a paper for
	each area we cover.  In addition, one student will be assigned
	to collate these summaries to write the page for this area,
	discussing the area in general, including the summariesof the
	papers we have read, and discussing open research problems. To
	give everyone a chance to write two area summaries, we will
	split areas into sub-areas as needed.</p>

      <p>Labs will consist of exercises that will help you to gain
	familiarity with some of the tools available to the research
	community. Labs will include using

	<a href="http://www.nsnam.org">ns3 simulator</a>

	and

	<a href="http://www.planet-lab.org/">PlanetLab</a>

	.</p>

      <p>The final project will be a research proposal that addresses an
	open question in the area of networking.  The report will take the
	format of a CS Master's Thesis proposal, describing why the problem is
	important, discussing related work, and outlining a research plan to
	solve the problem and validate the solution.</p>

      <h2>Grading</h2>

      <p>Grading will be based on an scale of 0 to 100, with standard letter
	grades assigned. Your final grade will be computed by weighting the
	assignments as follows:</p>

      <table>
	<col class="course">
	<tr><td>Paper Summaries and Area Summary</td><td>30%</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Labs</td><td>30%</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Research Project</td><td>40%</td></tr>
      </table>

      <h2>Group Work</h2>

      <p>Students may work in groups of two or three for the
	labs. Each student must still complete their individual Wiki
	and entries and research proposal. Each student in a group is
	expected to participate fully in all activities of every
	lab.</p>

      <h2>Late Policy</h2>

      <p>All work must be turned in on time -- turn in partial work if you
	are not done. Medical or other exceptions must be given prior to the
	due date.</p>

      <h2>Educational Policies</h2>

      <h3>Honor Code Standards</h3>

      <p>In keeping with the principles of the

	<a href="http://campuslife.byu.edu/honorcode/">BYU Honor Code</a>

	, students are expected to be honest in all of their academic
	work. Academic honesty means, most fundamentally, that any
	work you present as your own must in fact be your own work and
	not that of another. Violations of this principle may result
	in a failing grade in the course and additional disciplinary
	action by the university.</p>

      <p>For this course, some assignments are categorized as group
	work. For these assignments, you may form a group that works together
	to produce one solution. Any assignment not categorized as group work
	<b>must</b> be done individually. You are encouraged to
	generally discuss problems with other groups or students, but
	you may never use some other group's or student's solution or
	code in any way. The use of sources (ideas, quotations,
	paraphrases) must be properly acknowledged and documented.</p>

      <h3>Policy on Harassment</h3>

      <p>Harassment of any kind is inappropriate at BYU. Specifically,
	BYU's policy against sexual harassment extends not only to
	employees of the university but to students as well.  If you
	encounter sexual harassment, gender-based discrimination, or
	other inappropriate behavior, please talk to your professor,
	contact the Equal Employment Office at 422-5895 or 367-5689,
	or contact the Honor Code Office at 422-2847.</p>

      <h3>Policy on Disabilities</h3>

      <p>BYU is committed to providing reasonable accommodation to
	qualified persons with disabilities. If you have any
	disability that may adversely affect your success in this
	course, please contact the University Accessibility Center at
	422-2767.  Services deemed appropriate will be coordinated
	with the student and instructor by that office.</p>
